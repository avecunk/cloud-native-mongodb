# Workshop: Cloud Native NoSQL with MongoDB

This workshop is organised in multiple chapters.

Chapters have a theory part, which is covered in a slide deck, 
and often a practical part which is described in this git repository.

Chapters build up on one another and are represented as own *git branches*.

You'll see the next branch to checkout on the slide deck of the instructor.
